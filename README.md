# interface

This script is largely inspired from works of Dr. Francesco Raimondi in the [Cell paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31160049/)

For a given pair of chain IDs in a [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) complex, this script calculates all the interfaces between them and maps them to their equivalent positions in their corresponding proteins (UniProt Accession)

Example:
  ./interface.py 3sn6 R A
